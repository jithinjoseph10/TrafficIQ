# TrafficIQ
With the world becoming more urbanised, traffic congestion is still a big issue, particularly in
urban areas. Effective traffic management systems are essential for lowering traffic bottlenecks,
accelerating commutes, and decreasing the environmental impact of cars on the road. The rise
of smart cities has increased opportunities to better forecast and manage traffic flow through
the use of technology, particularly machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI and ML).
The TrafficIQ initiative is part of the larger Smart City Initiative, which aims to use data-driven
solutions to improve traffic conditions in urban areas. Developing a machine learning model
that can predict traffic volume for the next one, five, ten, thirty, and sixty minutes, among other
time periods, is the primary objective of this project. Traffic authorities and municipal planners
may make real-time system improvements thanks to TrafficIQ's accurate traffic volume
estimates, which enhance commuter happiness, road safety, and traffic flow
